    <strong>Dmitri Mikhailov</strong> is Principal Data Architect for TheLadders. Since joining the Company in 2004 he&#8217;s had to wear many hats: writing code for both the website and internal tools, designing data structures, optimizing payment systems among many other things. While moving all these disparate bits around (many!), he&#8217;s never panicked in those inevitable “the site is down!” situations. Dmitri is able to communicate in 15 different languages, including binary codes with a wide range of computers: from IBM 360 mainframes to tiny PLCs. His latest hobbies include 3D graphics, Linux kernel programming, studying the Chinese language, and trophy fishing.
