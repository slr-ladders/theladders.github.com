    <strong>Steve Rubinstein</strong> used to spend his days in dusty barns and homes under renovation, working as a reality TV producer on several home renovation shows and literally watching the paint dry. After several years he gave up that glamorous lifestyle and enrolled in Fullstack Academy to hone up his coding skills. He now enjoys writing code and solving interesting problems as a Front End Engineer with TheLadders while not wearing a dust mask and safety goggles.
