<h1>The problem</h1>

<p>When I was first tasked with writing the web service for our <a href="http://www.theladders.com/mobile/">jobseeker iOS app</a>, I wanted to be able to write tests against the API without diving into the world of iOS automated functional testing.  I really didn’t see a need to fire up an iOS client just so I could make calls to a service that was under heavy development and in a constant state of change.  So how could I write tests that would exercise the API in a way similar to an iOS client?</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, engineers at TheLadders have always emphasized testing in one form or another.  Sometimes this means a unit test for a particular method on a class.  Other times it means an automated functional test (AFT) verifying client/service interactions for a particular feature.  And in some instances it may even mean, f**k it, ship it and see if it blows up in production (a rare occurrence of course).</p>

<p>It turns out that before I even started working on the mobile service, people before me were asking similar questions about testing their APIs, and they had come up with a slightly different type of test that we now call &ldquo;web tests&rdquo;.  A &ldquo;web test&rdquo; is basically a way to fire up an instance of the service for each test and, using a Jersey client, programmatically make calls to that service within the test itself.  This was great because it allowed us to write tests against our APIs without needing to fire up an external tool such as a web browser.  The following code is an example of such a test:</p>

<p><code>java Basic web test
TestRestClient client = createTestRestClient();
Response response = client.get(“api/jobs”);
assertEquals(200, response.getStatus());
</code></p>

<p>This code makes a call to retrieve a list of jobs and verifies the response status code is 200.</p>

<p>The idea of the “web” or “API test” was exactly what I needed.  This gave me a starting point.  But I knew these web tests could be improved upon, making it easier to test our APIs.  So I set about trying to figure out what I wanted for testing the mobile service and came up with a list of requirements.</p>

<h1>The requirements</h1>

<p>There were some requirements I wanted to establish that would help guide my decision-making process when writing web tests.  These requirements included the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The tests should mimic how an iOS client would navigate the API</li>
<li>Anyone reading the test code should be able to easily understand what is being tested</li>
<li>The code should be easy to reuse, reducing duplication where possible</li>
</ul>


<p>These really aren’t groundbreaking ideas, but they were helpful to keep in mind at all times.  They served as guideposts throughout my decision-making process.  With these requirements defined, I&rsquo;m going to give you a quick rundown of some key elements of the API before diving into implementation details.</p>

<h1>The API</h1>

<p>The API for the mobile service is a RESTful API that uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)</a>.  We use the HTTP methods GET, DELETE, POST, and PUT against URLs representing resources.  Everything is stateless and we leverage headers for things such as authorization and versioning.  The following figure illustrates sample request and response against this API:</p>

<p><img class="center medium" src="/images/api-tests/api-request-response.png"></p>

<p>The above example illustrates a request for the details of an individual job.  One important thing to note here is the “links” element in the JSON.  This is the HATEOAS piece I mentioned earlier. If a user taps the “like” button on the app for this particular job, the client code would send a request to the URL associated with the “like” action.  If the job was already liked when it was retrieved, then an “unlike” link would have been present instead.</p>

<p>We use hypermedia links extensively in the API.  In fact, the only URL that is hard-coded in the iOS application is what we call a “bootstrap” URL.  This URL gives the client all of the hypermedia links needed to get started with the app, and would look something like the following:</p>

<p>``` json Bootstrap JSON response
{
  &ldquo;links&rdquo; : [{</p>

<pre><code>"action" : "authenticate",
"method" : "POST",
"uri" : "https://localhost:54837/authenticate",
</code></pre>

<p>  }, {</p>

<pre><code>"action" : "lookupIndustries",
"method" : "GET",
"uri" : "https://localhost:54837/api/lookup/industries",
</code></pre>

<p>  }, {</p>

<pre><code>"action" : "autocompleteTitle",
"method" : "GET",
"uri" : "https://localhost:54837/api/autocomplete/title?q={toMatch}",
</code></pre>

<p>  }, {</p>

<pre><code>"action" : "register",
"method" : "POST",
"uri" : "https://localhost:54837/register",
</code></pre>

<p>  }]
}
```</p>

<p>From here, the client has the links for retrieving some lookup lists, maybe a URL for auto-completing the job title field, a link for logging in an existing user, and a link for registering a new user.  If the link to login is invoked, then new response JSON will be returned containing “links” for valid actions that user can perform, and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>There is more to the API and I’ve glossed over some details.  But this should give you enough of an idea of how things work to understand the implementation.</p>

<h1>The implementation</h1>

<p>It’s important to keep in mind that the following implementation has evolved over time.  What I present to you here is an example that identifies the key components of the current state.  I was always going back-and-forth with different ideas, trying out various implementations.  And I’m pretty certain the team will continue to iterate on what we have today.</p>

<p>But in its current state, the implementation has the following four components:</p>

<ol>
<li>Class representing request/response JSON</li>
<li>Class for performing asserts against a body of JSON</li>
<li>Class representing the actions that can be taken on a body of JSON (such as calling hypermedia links or accessing an item in a list)</li>
<li>Class representing a user, their state, and their “connection” to the API.</li>
</ol>


<p>These four components and how they relate to the API can be seen in the following figure:</p>

<p><img class="center medium" src="/images/api-tests/api-implementation-components.png"></p>

<p>In addition to these four components, I did my  best to provide some “syntactic sugar” for allowing us to write tests in the given/when/then style.  So let’s dive into each of the four components and give you some concrete examples to work with.</p>

<h2>Class representing request/response JSON</h2>

<p>We have what are called “representation” classes whose sole purpose is to “represent” incoming or outgoing JSON.  These classes are annotated with JAXB annotations for serialization/deserialization purposes.  These classes also have methods for accessing the hypermedia links (some of which may be optional).  So the following JSON:</p>

<p>``` json Job JSON
{
  &ldquo;details&rdquo; : {</p>

<pre><code>"title" : "Software Engineer", 
"company" : "TheLadders", 
"location" : "New York, NY", 
"postedOn" : "2015-04-17", 
"salary" : "$100k", 
"description" : "Work with us!" 
</code></pre>

<p>  },
  &ldquo;links&rdquo; : [ {</p>

<pre><code>"action" : "like",
"method" : "POST", 
"uri" : "https://localhost:54837/api/jobs/e-1/like" 
</code></pre>

<p>  }, {</p>

<pre><code>"action" : "get",
"method" : "GET", 
"uri" : "https://localhost:54837/api/jobs/e-1" 
</code></pre>

<p>  } ]
}
```</p>

<p>Would be represented by a class that looks like:</p>

<p>``` java JobRepresentation.java
@XmlRootElement
@XmlAccessorType(XmlAccessType.FIELD)
public class JobRepresentation
{
  public JobDetailRepresentation details;
  public HypermediaLinks links;</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public Optional<HypermediaLink> likeLink()
  {</p>

<pre><code>return Optional.ofNullable(links.forAction(“like”));
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public Optional<HypermediaLink> unlikeLink()
  {</p>

<pre><code>return Optional.ofNullable(links.forAction(“unlike”));
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public HypermediaLink getLink()
  {</p>

<pre><code>return links.forAction(“get”);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>The methods for the links are particularly useful when navigating the API in a way an actual client would in tests.  Having defined a class representing a body of JSON, let&rsquo;s move on to the class for performing assertions against this body of JSON.</p>

<h2>Class for performing asserts against a body of JSON</h2>

<p>Having a class for performing assertions against a particular body of JSON helps us achieve two goals:  1) write more expressive test code and 2) have assertions that can be reused across tests.  For example, there may be several tests that require asserting the title for a particular job returned by the API.  We may also want to verify the presence or absence of certain hypermedia links.  The following code illustrates an “asserts” class for a job representation.</p>

<p>``` java JobRepresentationAsserts.java
public class JobRepresentationAsserts
{
  private final JobRepresentation representation;</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public void hasTitleOf(String title)
  {</p>

<pre><code>assertEquals(title, representation.details.title);
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public void hasLikeLink()
  {</p>

<pre><code>assertTrue(representation.likeLink().isPresent());
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public void doesNotHaveLikeLink()
  {</p>

<pre><code>assertFalse(representation.likeLink().isPresent());
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public void hasUnlikeLink()
  {</p>

<pre><code>assertTrue(representation.unlikeLink().isPresent());
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public void doesNotHaveUnlikeLink()
  {</p>

<pre><code>assertFalse(representation.unlikeLink().isPresent());
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>In addition to these “asserts” classes, I created a class with static builder methods to provide some syntactic sugar.  This allows us to write our tests in a given/when/then fashion.  This builder class is as follows:</p>

<p>``` java AssertsBuilder.java
public class AssertsBuilder
{
  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public static JobRepresentationAsserts thenThe(JobRepresentation representation)
  {</p>

<pre><code>return new JobRepresentationAsserts(representation);
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  &hellip;
}
```</p>

<p>This results in something like the following in a test:</p>

<p>``` java Sample job test
import static com.theladders.AssertsBuilder.*;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>JobRepresentation job = apiCallToGetJob();
thenThe(job).hasTitleOf(“Software Engineer”);
thenThe(job).hasLikeLink();
```</p>

<p>We’re not there yet, but we’re making progress.  So far we have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Class for representing incoming/outgoing bodies of JSON</li>
<li>Class for performing assertions against a particular body of JSON</li>
<li>Some syntactic sugar for creating assert-related objects.</li>
</ul>


<p>The next piece of the puzzle is a class representing the actions that can be taken on a body of JSON.</p>

<h2>Class representing the actions that can be taken on a body of JSON</h2>

<p>What exactly do I mean by &ldquo;taking actions on a body of JSON&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Actions&rdquo; can include anything from selecting an individual item in a list (a job in a list of jobs) to calling a URL associated with a hypermedia link.  So why the need for a separate class encapsulating these &ldquo;actions&rdquo; when we already have a representation class for a body of JSON (which includes hypermedia links)?  The reason is rooted in the fact that our representation classes are used in production code for serialization purposes (a topic worthy of its own blog post), and I didn&rsquo;t want to mix in testing concerns with our representation classes for something like calling the API via TestRestClient.  So I decided to create a different type of class for this purpose.  I called this the &ldquo;actions&rdquo; class.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at JSON containing a list of jobs as an example.  If a user is viewing a list of jobs, it&rsquo;s reasonable to expect they might want to &ldquo;do something&rdquo; with a particular job.  This would be captured with something like the following:</p>

<p>``` java JobListActions.java
public class JobListActions
{
  public UserAndClient userAndClient; // this class represents a user and their connection to the API and will be discussed next.
  public JobListRepresentation representation;</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public JobActions actingOnJobAtIndex(int index)
  {</p>

<pre><code>return new JobActions(userAndClient, representation.jobs.get(index));
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>JobListActions by itself isn’t necessarily interesting, but it does provide a nice way for indicating what job a user is acting upon in a test.  The next code listing is more interesting, providing methods for performing various “actions” an individual job.</p>

<p>``` java JobActions.java
public class JobActions
{
  private final UserAndClient userAndClient; // this class represents a user and their connection to the API and will be discussed next
  private final JobRepresentation representation;</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public Response<JobRepresentation> like()
  {</p>

<pre><code>Optional&lt;HypermediaLink&gt; link = representation.likeLink();
return new Response&lt;&gt;(userAndClient.client.post(link.get()), JobRepresentation.class);
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public Response<JobRepresentation> unlike()
  {</p>

<pre><code>Optional&lt;HypermediaLink&gt; link = representation.unlikeLink();
return new Response&lt;&gt;(userAndClient.client.post(link.get()), JobRepresentation.class);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>This class contains methods for liking and un-liking a job.  This is done by using the TestRestClient found in UserAndClient (more on this next) to make calls to the API via the hypermedia links.  The Response class that is returned from these methods is a simple wrapper class for a JAX-RS response and looks like the following:</p>

<p>``` java Response.java
public class Response<T>
{
  private final javax.ws.rs.core.Response response;
  private final Class<T> responseBodyType;</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public int status()
  {</p>

<pre><code>return response.getStatus();
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public T body()
  {</p>

<pre><code>return response.readEntity(responseBodyType);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>So we have all of these separate pieces:  1) representation class, 2) representation asserts class, and 3) class for performing actions against a representation.  By themselves, these three pieces really aren’t that useful.  We need something to pull them together.  This is where the UserAndClient alluded to earlier comes in.</p>

<h2>Class representing a user, their state, and their “connection” to the API</h2>

<p>This class is used for encapsulating a user and how they make calls to the API.  State for a particular user is kept here.  This class acts as the launching point for navigating through the API.  The code in the following listing provides methods for viewing job matches and being able to act upon the viewed job matches.</p>

<p>``` java UserAndClient.java
public class UserAndClient
{
  public AuthenticatedUserRepresentation user;
  public TestRestClient client;</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public JobListRepresentation jobMatches;</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public JobListRepresentation viewsJobMatches()
  {</p>

<pre><code>HypermediaLink link = user.jobMatchesLink();
jobMatches = client.post(link).readEntity(JobListRepresentation.class);
return jobMatches;
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public JobListActions actingOn(JobListRepresentation representation)
  {</p>

<pre><code>return new JobListAction(this, representation);
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  &hellip;
}
```</p>

<p>With some additional syntactic sugar, we are able to use UserAndClient to write very expressive tests with decoupled and reusable components.  Our base test class provides this syntactic sugar:</p>

<p>``` java RegisteredUserWebTest.java
public class RegisteredUserWebTest extends WebTest
{
  protected UserAndClient me;</p>

<p>  @Before
  public void setUp()
  {</p>

<pre><code>me = createNewUserAndClient();
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  &hellip;</p>

<p>  public UserAndClient given(UserAndClient userAndClient)
  {</p>

<pre><code>return userAndClient;
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public UserAndClient when(UserAndClient userAndClient)
  {</p>

<pre><code>return userAndClient;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>We are then able to put it all together in a test such as the following:</p>

<p>``` java LikeJobWebTest.java
public class LikeJobWebTest extends RegisteredUserWebTest
{
  @Test
  public void likingJobReturnsResultWithUnlikeLink()
  {</p>

<pre><code>given(me).viewsJobMatches();
Response&lt;JobRepresentation&gt; response = when(me).actingOn(me.jobMatches)
                                               .actingOnJobAtIndex(0)
                                               .like();
thenThe(response).hasStatusOfOk();

JobRepresentation job = response.body();
thenThe(job).doesNotHaveLikeLink();
thenThe(job).hasUnlikeLink();
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>Looking at the above test, it’s pretty clear what is happening.  A user views their job matches.  From there, they like a single job in the list.  We are then verifying that the response of that like contains JSON without a like link (so they cannot “like” a job two times in a row).</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>Overall the results have been positive.  We have fairly reusable test code that minimizes duplication.  At first glance it may seem like a lot of unnecessary classes (representation asserts &amp; a class for encapsulating “actions”).  But creating these classes forces us to really think about the API as we develop.  An “asserts” class forces us to zero in on the needs of the client.  The “actions” class gives us a feel for whether or not we are providing the best API in terms of hypermedia links and navigating between URLs.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we wanted something that would result in an API that met the needs of it’s customer (the iOS client), and I think we’ve achieved that.  By “eating our own dog food” via navigating the hypermedia links in our web tests, we are putting ourselves in the shoes of the iOS client, and the result has been increased test coverage with tests that are easy to extend and understand.</p>

<p>Hopefully you have found this useful.  I realize I&rsquo;ve glossed over some of the finer details, such as &ldquo;what is actually inside of the TestRestClient&rdquo; class?  This blog post wasn&rsquo;t meant to give you the exact template for doing what we do here at TheLadders.  It was meant to get you thinking about how you are testing your APIs and possible ways to improve upon how that is done.  I&rsquo;m sure what we have today will look much different six months for now.  While not perfect, it has resulted in what I think are more stable APIs, and at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s a win in my book.</p>

<p>Now time to go test that new Storm topology of mine in production and see if it works&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>If you don&rsquo;t like testing your product, most likely your customers won&rsquo;t like to test it either.</p><footer><strong>&mdash; Anonymous</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>When we started our new <a href="https://www.theladders.com/careers/search">job market guide</a>
project (a site where career-minded professionals can check out open positions
and stats such as average compensation), the question of testing came up pretty
quickly. We had used <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/">Jasmine</a> for
JavaScript unit testing on a previous project so we kept using it, but it wasn&rsquo;t enough.
Our Jasmine tests could pass, but the site might not actually work. We needed
end-to-end tests.</p>

<p>One of the new tools we found was <a href="http://casperjs.org/">CasperJS</a>. It&rsquo;s a neat
JavaScript project that uses <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> to open a headless
browser, go to your site, take some actions and then make assertions. We&rsquo;re using
CasperJS for end-to-end testing and we&rsquo;re automating the test runs with
<a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a snippet of a test for our &lsquo;share&rsquo; feature:
``` javascript
function emailCaptureTopFormTest() {</p>

<pre><code>casper.then(givenCareersPage);
casper.then(whenEmailFormIsFilledOut);
casper.then(thenConfirmationIsShown);
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>function givenCareersPage() {</p>

<pre><code>casper.open(DOMAIN + 'careers/NY/sales/1');
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>function whenEmailFormIsFilledOut() {</p>

<pre><code>casper.click('[data-js="email-capture__top-link-test"]');
casper.sendKeys(topFormInputSelector, 'jblocktest' + new Date().getTime() + '@theladders.net');
casper.click('[data-js="email-capture__top-submit"]');
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>function thenConfirmationIsShown() {</p>

<pre><code>casper.waituntilVisible('[data-js="email-capture__confirmation"]',
        util.success("email confirmation ok"),
        util.failWithScreenshot("email-confirmation-fail",
                                "email confirmation didn't appear",
                                SCREENSHOT_OPTIONS));
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The test opens up the page, fills out the form, and makes sure the confirmation
window appears. If it doesn&rsquo;t appear, the test takes a screenshot and reports a failure.</p>

<p>The tests are generally pretty fast. We use Grunt to kick off the test suites
so that all you need to do to run them is type <code>grunt test</code>. (That&rsquo;s a lot
easier to remember than <code>casperjs --ssl-protocol=any --ignore-ssl-errors=true
test path/to/tests</code>!) Simpler tests are typically less than a second to run,
but there are a few slower tests that rely on external services, which can
take as long as 15 seconds to run. This led to concerns about the test run
time. We want to run the whole suite of tests frequently, but we don&rsquo;t want it
to take a couple of minutes each time.</p>

<p>The solution I went with was running them in parallel. They&rsquo;re all independent
so there&rsquo;s no need for any test to wait for any other test to finish. CasperJS
doesn&rsquo;t officially support parallelization so I jury-rigged something together
with a shell script. It gets each test file, runs them all as background processes
and redirects their output to temporary files. Once that&rsquo;s done, it cats all the
output in order and then uses <code>grep</code> to print failures at the end.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some sample output after the test suite has run:
```text
Test file: /casper/tests/no_search_results_test.js</p>

<h1>search no results test</h1>

<p>PASS no-jobs-search-ok: Saw no jobs container
PASS 1 test executed in 2.227s, 1 passed, 0 failed, 0 dubious, 0 skipped.</p>

<p>Done, without errors.</p>

<hr />

<p>FAIL PremiumSignupTestfail:  Expected pricing form. Didn&rsquo;t see it.</p>

<h1>file: /casper/tests/premium_signup_test.js</h1>

<p>FAIL 1 test executed in 13.195s, 0 passed, 1 failed, 0 dubious, 0 skipped.</p>

<p>real    0m25.646s
user    1m16.980s
sys 0m7.416s
^ Time it took for this task.
```</p>

<p>I used the <code>time</code> command to print out how long the suite takes. It&rsquo;s now
around 25s instead of 90s+. That is, the run time is the slowest test&rsquo;s run
time plus some overhead. That&rsquo;s a big improvement over the sum of all the tests'
 run times!</p>

<p>This was great when we only had a few tests, but as the suite grew larger, I
noticed the server was starting to struggle. It could handle five connections
 opening at once, but a hundred was causing tests to time out. My solution for
this was to split the tests into smaller batches. Instead of running 100 tests
all at once and bringing the server down, I can run two sets of 50. It&rsquo;s a
little slower than it would be if they could all run at once, but it&rsquo;s definitely
faster than having some tests randomly time out and fail.</p>

<p>Now that the casper tests are quick and easy to run, they&rsquo;re being used more
frequently and catching errors faster. Some developers are writing casper tests
before they write the actual code, too.</p>

<p>While CasperJS is a great tool for testing interactions and catching errors (like
forms not submitting correctly), it doesn&rsquo;t particularly care about how the page
looks. The casper tests will happily pass even if no CSS loads on the page. A
human would obviously see something is broke, but the casper tests won&rsquo;t. We
wanted to be able to catch problems like that without manually looking at
every page. Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a tool for that:
<a href="https://github.com/Huddle/PhantomCSS">PhantomCSS</a>.</p>

<p>PhantomCSS builds on top of CasperJS. It takes screenshots of your
site and then after you&rsquo;ve done work, it takes new screenshots. It then compares
the two and highlights any changes. This can be incredibly useful. For example,
suppose you&rsquo;re changing the header on one pager to be centered. If this accidentally
center headers on other pages, that will show up as a failure in PhantomCSS.</p>

<p>Since PhantomCSS tests run the same way as the casper tests, I was able to use the
same method to run them in parallel. Like with casper tests, individually they&rsquo;re
pretty quick, but running them all sequentially can be slow. Running them in
parallel is a big time saver.</p>

<p>Now that we are using CasperJS and PhantomJS, our confidence when releasing has
gone way up. We no longer need to manually check styles on every page because
PhantomCSS will show us every change. We don’t need to click through flows because
CasperJS does that for us. We&rsquo;ve been releasing new bug-free features at a consistent
rate that wouldn&rsquo;t be possible if we were still manually testing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!&rdquo;</p><footer><strong>&mdash;Edsger W. Dijkstra</strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>When we started out building our <a href="http://www.cenedella.com/job-search/job-offer-guaranteed-signature/">Signature program</a>, we had a goal in mind &ndash; test the &lt;insert expletive of choice here&gt; out of it.  We also wanted to make sure that not only did we test it, but we tested it right.  Regular code line coverage tools like <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/clover/overview">Clover</a> are great, but typically only tell you that a line of code was executed &ndash; not necessarily that it was verified.  Many developers often see them as a way to determine what&rsquo;s been tested, but in reality they are better at<em> highlighting code that hasn&rsquo;t been tested at all</em>.</p>

<p>Our interest in mutation testing stemmed from a talk about how occasionally we see bad/ineffective tests, ones that give the impression of testing the code but in reality don&rsquo;t do a great job.  <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanTAllen">Sean T Allen</a> and I had apparently both already been looking into a new tool, because once the discussion came up we were already on the same page.  Enter <a href="http://pitest.org/">PIT</a>, a mutation testing tool under active development.  We decided to try it out in combination with Clover, and the results were:</p>

<h1>But first, what is mutation testing?</h1>

<p>For those unfamiliar with how mutation testing works, I&rsquo;ll offer a brief summary.  After your sources and tests are compiled and run, a mutation test framework like PIT will alter the program code and insert ‘mutations’, such as changing != to == or completely removing a line.  It will then run the tests that exercise that chunk of code again, with the expectation that at least one of them should now fail.  If your tests are well written, or more importantly, <em>complete</em>, then at least one assertion should have been broken by PIT’s change.  (For more, <a href="http://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-tools/mutation-testing/">Jeremy Jarrell’s introduction</a> (first 2 sections) sums it up pretty well)</p>

<h1></h1>

<h1>Your 100% coverage?  It’s a lie.</h1>

<p>You write a test &ndash; it&rsquo;s green and all is well.  But are you <em>certain</em> that it will fail if someone mistakenly alters the code?  “Yea, I have tons-o-coverage” you say?  Typical line coverage tools like Clover can lull you into a false sense of security by showing 100% coverage without really delivering on that promise.  And that’s probably fine &ndash; heck, a lot of teams/projects would be happy to break 90% overall line coverage (or 50%&hellip;or 20%).  But there are a few of us here that border on insane and try to push the envelope &ndash; more, more, more!</p>

<h1>So what&rsquo;s so great/different about mutation testing?</h1>

<h2>Testing your tests:</h2>

<p>One of the most important long-term benefits of a test is not knowing that it passes, but rather knowing that it will fail if the code is broken.  When not TDDing, I tend to alter the code or comment out blocks and ensure that the test fails as expected.  Sometimes we write tests that don&rsquo;t fail correctly with the code they test: maybe because of a mistaken assumption, or maybe because of a slight oversight &ndash; it happens.  Mutation testing is an effective, automated way of enforcing that tests fail correctly.</p>

<h2>Code is verified:</h2>

<p>PIT provides a way of ensuring that you&rsquo;ve written complete tests that verify the results of executing a piece of code.  The core concept of mutation testing is a powerful one &ndash; if you botch a line of code, a test should break somewhere.  If a test doesn&rsquo;t break, it means your tests aren&rsquo;t complete, the test may be wrong, or the line of code just flat out isn&rsquo;t doing anything.  In one case, we discovered dead code that was identified by PIT when switching our storage model.</p>

<p>Depending on how far you believe in test coverage in general and mutation testing itself, it can be a great ally.  We decided to aim high &ndash; test everything.  PIT was vital in ensuring that we were actually verifying each line of code that we set out to.</p>

<h1>An Example:</h1>

<p>To illustrate an example of what PIT does, consider the below (very basic) class and test:</p>

<p>``` java PersonFactory <a href="https://github.com/TheLadders/pit-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/theladders/PersonFactory.java">https://github.com/TheLadders/pit-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/theladders/PersonFactory.java</a> Source
public class PersonFactory
{
  public Person createPerson()
  {</p>

<pre><code>Person person = new Person();
person.setFirstName("First");
person.setLastName("Last");
return person;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
<code>
</code> java Person <a href="https://github.com/TheLadders/pit-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/theladders/Person.java">https://github.com/TheLadders/pit-example/blob/master/src/main/java/com/theladders/Person.java</a> Source
public class Person
{
  private String firstName;
  private String lastName;</p>

<p>  public String getFirstName()
  {</p>

<pre><code>return firstName;
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public void setFirstName(String firstName)
  {</p>

<pre><code>this.firstName = firstName;
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public String getLastName()
  {</p>

<pre><code>return lastName;
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  public void setLastName(String lastName)
  {</p>

<pre><code>this.lastName = lastName;
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
<code>
</code> java PersonFactoryTest <a href="https://github.com/TheLadders/pit-example/blob/master/src/test/java/com/theladders/PersonFactoryTest.java">https://github.com/TheLadders/pit-example/blob/master/src/test/java/com/theladders/PersonFactoryTest.java</a> Source
public class PersonFactoryTest
{
  @Test
  public void test()
  {</p>

<pre><code>Person person = new PersonFactory().createPerson();
String firstName = person.getFirstName();
String lastName = person.getLastName();
assertEquals("First", firstName);
// forgot test for last name
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<p>Clover (and PIT) will say that the <em><strong>line</strong></em> coverage is 100%.  But at a close glance &ndash; how many untested pieces of code do you see?  PIT <em><strong>mutation</strong></em> coverage will point out that there are 2 &ndash; the call to person.setLastName(&ldquo;Last&rdquo;) and the getLastName() method.  Both were executed as part of the test, but neither are actually verified for correctness.</p>

<h2>Clover Results:</h2>

<h2><img src="/images/clover.png" alt="clover results" /></h2>

<h2>PIT Results:</h2>

<h2><img src="/images/pit-failure.png" alt="pit failure" /></h2>

<h2><img src="/images/person-factory.png" alt="PersonFactory class" /></h2>

<p>(Person report excluded for brevity)</p>

<p>You’ll notice that the setLastName method in the PersonFactory is highlighted in red, with an explanation below:
removed call to com/theladders/Person::setLastName : SURVIVED</p>

<p>What this means is that PIT altered the code and removed the call to setLastName() completely, ran the tests again, and they all still passed &ndash; meaning that the mutation survived.  You’ll also notice that it tried the same thing for setFirstName(), but it was successfully killed by our test (it failed, as it should).</p>

<p>Once we add a test for last name, we’ll see that PIT will now report that all mutations are killed.  Essentially what it means, is that PIT couldn’t find a way to screw with the code without breaking a test.</p>

<p>``` java PersonFactoryTest <a href="https://github.com/TheLadders/pit-example/blob/master/src/test/java/com/theladders/PersonFactoryTest.java">https://github.com/TheLadders/pit-example/blob/master/src/test/java/com/theladders/PersonFactoryTest.java</a> Source
public class PersonFactoryTest
{
  @Test
  public void test()
  {</p>

<pre><code>Person person = new PersonFactory().createPerson();
String firstName = person.getFirstName();
String lastName = person.getLastName();
assertEquals("First", firstName);
assertEquals("Last", lastName);
</code></pre>

<p>  }
}
```</p>

<h2>PIT Results afterwards:</h2>

<h2><img src="/images/pit-success.png" alt="Pit success" /></h2>

<p>This was a very trivial example, and PIT supports much more than what I&rsquo;ve shown you here.  As you may have noticed, I skipped over one of the killed mutations: if (x != null) null else throw new RuntimeException.  This is another type of fault that PIT will try to introduce for return objects.  The full list of mutations can be found <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators/">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Our Experience with PIT:</h1>

<p>We started using it last year on a new project with some really great success.  As part of it, we were building a RESTful web service with Jersey.  It was a green field project with no legacy code &ndash; everything written from scratch except for small internal libraries.  We tested almost every meaningful thing we could about the server (web interfaces, security XML configs, null validation rules, etc).  It was very heavy on integration tests &ndash; some just verified all the business components working together and some deployed the server on embedded Jetty and hit the web endpoints.  Towards the end we were maintaining around 98% in both Clover and PIT (excluding Data Transfer Object classes), and ended up around 95%.</p>

<p>While we also used Clover for basic code coverage, as we got our PIT mutation coverage up into the 90s I stopped paying much attention to Clover.  Our use of PIT was to ensure that we were actually testing and verifying all the parts of the code that we thought we were, and to find the places where we needed to fill in more tests or assertions.  We would add/modify tests so that each line of code we wrote (almost) was also backed by an assertion somewhere.  Essentially, &ldquo;Hey PIT, where do I need to add more tests and assertions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This gave us extreme confidence in our tests &ndash; if the code was modified incorrectly (with some small exceptions), a test would break and we knew it.  The effects of that confidence were outstanding.  At TheLadders we place a lot of value in code quality and &ldquo;doing things right,&rdquo; so refactoring is a large part of our process.  It enabled us to refactor at will with little fear of breaking anything, which happened quite frequently in many different ways, especially as a new project growing from the ground up.</p>

<p>The best example of a big win was a refactoring to shift how we stored and tracked state.  When we first started out, we were creating and updating rows in the database (update in place).  We decided to switch to an <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event Sourcing</a> approach &ndash; instead of storing/retrieving state in the database, we instead stored &lsquo;actions&rsquo; and inputs in the database and then rebuilt the state in memory from those actions.  This was a large change to how a lot of the internals operated, and would normally carry a big risk factor in breaking existing functionality.  In this case, that risk factor was minimal and hardly played a part in our decision.  Because of the confidence we had in our tests thanks to PIT (and the fact that the majority of them were high level integration tests), all we did was start switching over and making changes until the tests were green again, and we were done.  The tests were the ultimate source of how the server needed to act, and PIT helped ensure that those tests covered everything the server was expected to do.</p>
